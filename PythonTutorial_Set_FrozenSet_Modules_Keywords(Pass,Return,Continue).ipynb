For example, if you have a list of email addresses, converting it to a set will automatically remove any duplicate email addresses.\n","\n","* ### Testing for Membership: Sets offer a fast way to check whether an element is present in a collection. For instance, you can use sets to check if a username is already taken in a user database.\n","\n","* ### Finding Unique Elements: Sets are ideal for finding unique elements in a dataset. For instance, in data analysis, you might want to find unique values in a column of a dataset to analyze distinct categories.\n","\n","* ### Set Operations in Mathematics: Sets are fundamental in solving mathematical problems. Union, intersection, and difference operations can be used to solve problems related to sets.\n","\n","* ### Data Deduplication in Databases: In databases, sets can be employed to store unique records, avoiding duplication in large datasets.\n","\n","* ### Checking for Common Interests: In social networking or dating applications, sets can be used to match users with common interests by comparing sets of hobbies or preferences.\n","\n","* ### Sets in Python are implemented as hash tables, which provide efficient time complexities for common set operations.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"iCO_rHxSeilk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Frozen sets:**\n","\n","### Frozen sets in Python are similar to normal sets, but with one key difference i.e. they are immutable in nature.
