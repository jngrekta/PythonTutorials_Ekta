Write a function with the name reverse_string that takes a string as a parameter and returns the reverse of the string.\n","\n","2. Write a function called print_info that takes a person's name, age, and occupation in parameters, and prints their information. The function should have default parameters for age and occupation, such as \"Unknown\" and \"Unemployed\". Test the function by calling it with different combinations of parameters, both with and without specifying the default parameters.\n","\n","3. Write a function called get_user_input that prompts the user to enter a number and returns the entered number. The function should not take any parameters.\n","\n","4. Write a function called get_name_and_age that takes a person's name and age as parameters and returns both name and age as a tuple. Test the function by calling it and printing the returned values.\n","\n","5. Write a recursive function called reverse_string that takes a string as a parameter and returns its reverse. Test the function by calling it with different strings and printing the reversed strings.\n","\n","6. Write a recursive function called factorial that takes a positive integer as a parameter and computes its factorial. Test the function by calling it with different values and printing the results.\n","\n","7. Write a function called calculate_price that takes a positional argument quantity and a keyword argument price_per_unit. Calculate the total price by multiplying the quantity and price per unit.
